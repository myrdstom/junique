# Junique challenge

Simple form styling as per the Junique requirements

## Setup
- Clone the github repository: `https://github.com/myrdstom/junique.git`
- Install all dependencies with `yarn` or `npm install`
- run the application with `yarn start` or `npm start`


## Points of note

- Have not exhaustively catered for state and validation as this was outside the scope challenge. 
Many input fields are not validated

- implemented dynamic change of some labels based on screen size. Used a native implementation but libraries like react-media
can be utilized to further improve code quality

- I do have extra spans in the html in regards to a query fo yours. The reason was specifically to easier manage grids

- A few small changes made and pushed directly to master. They will not reflect on any PRs
